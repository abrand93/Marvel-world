# Project1-Marvel-API

## Description
Our goal is to creat an easy access of information on all of our favorite Marvel characters.
We wanted one central location to look up all of the characters that Marvel has to offer.
We no longer have to Google individual characters, but instead, we can them displayed in one central location.
We learned how to work as a team. First, we learned how to merge feature branches. Second, we learned how to create pull requests. Lastly, we also learned how to divide up the tasks amongst each other. 

## Installation
There is nothing required to be installed.  You just need a link to the site.
## Usage
Either enter your favorite character in the search bar or select a random avenger button.  By doing so, you will get information on a Marvel character as well as a picture of them.
