# Project1-Marvel-API

## Description
- Our goal is to create an easy access of information on all of our favorite Marvel characters.
We wanted one central location to look up all of the characters that Marvel has to offer. We no longer have to Google individual characters, but instead, we can have them displayed in one central location.

- We learned how to work as a team. First, we learned how to merge feature branches. Second, we learned how to create pull requests. Lastly, we also learned how to divide up the tasks amongst each other. 

## Installation
- There is nothing required to be installed. You can use the following link to navigate to the wep page:
    https://abrand93.github.io/Marvel-world/

## Usage
- Either enter your favorite character in the search bar or select a random avenger button. By doing so, you will get information on a Marvel character as well as a picture of them.

- You can click on 'show more information' to get further description about a character.

- The following pictures show how the page would look:
